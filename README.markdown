Display Access Keys
==========================

A Chrome extension which shows subtle hints of the access keys
provided by the site's developer.

This is based on a Firefox customization discussed in
[this blog post](http://blog.andrewbeacock.com/2007/06/firefox-hack-to-display-accesskey.html).

(This and another extension of mine got mixed up in the Chrome
webstore. If you're looking for "Text into Multiple Columns", find it
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhhbngmbgcjkdfmdnbjpocafoednnhfj?hl=en-US).)
